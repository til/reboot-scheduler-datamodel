The datamodel of the scheduler for the reboot radio software.

It contains a lot of openacs specific elements that don't make a lot
of sense without an understanding of the openacs internals, please try
to read over it. Also a lot of functionality of the overall system is
not reflected in this datamodel because it is supported by standard
mechanisms of the openacs framework, especially user and permissions
management.

The most relevant part of these files is in radio-programs-create.sql
- the tables programs, emissions.

radio-recurring-create.sql contains the datamodel to store recurring
time specifications (e.g. "every thursday 18:00-19:00", or "every 2nd
and 4th wednesday of the month 12:00-14:00"), which are both used by
programs and by containers.

radio-containers-create.sql defines the containers - which are
recurring time frames that are used to divide areas of responsibility
between different editorial groups of the radio.

Feel free to contact me if there are any questions.
